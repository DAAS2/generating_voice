[Boy] Bro, I just saw the most wild thing…
[Girl] Spill the tea! What happened?
[Boy] This girl was filming a TikTok…
[Girl] Okay, and? Everyone does that.
[Boy] …but she kept using the crying filter for no reason! Bruh.
[Girl] Wait, what? That's kinda sus.
[Boy] No cap! Turns out… she's an actress practicing her Oscar acceptance speech.
[Girl] Method acting gone wrong!
