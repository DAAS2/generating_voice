[Boy] Bro, just saw my neighbor doing the griddy...
[Girl] Bruh, no way, record it!
[Boy] I did! But wait what? He stopped...
[Girl] And...? Don't leave me hanging!
[Boy] He pulled out a trombone.
[Girl] A trombone?! No cap?
[Boy] Dead serious!
[Girl] He's starting a marching band, isn't he?
[Boy] Worse. He's my Uber driver.
